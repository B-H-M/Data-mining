Welcome to Data mining Module assignment

Please set up a repository and make a few commits 
(for now, it can be commits of Readme file written in markdown).

Paste link to your repository so I can check that you are 
able to work with git version control system or, 
if you have configured this as a private repository - 
send a screenshot (saved as pdf)showing commits history.
